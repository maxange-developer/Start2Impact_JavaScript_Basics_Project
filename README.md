# Overview üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

This is my second project on Start2Impact University. The project involved creating a counter using JavaScript. As a technical requirement there are the implementation of the buttons +, -, reset and the value of the counter via JavaScript.

I decided to leave the HTML blank and create all the elements with the various classes and id only via JavaScript. 

First of all I create a function that being called assigns several parameters including the name, the class and the id. 
After creating all the elements I created the counter function that makes the value always positive and changes it according to the button that is clicked.

I use CSS for the graphics of the page. I tried to make the page elegant and professional. I created a transparent 'card' with a 'blob' in the background that moves inside the screen and that 'opens' when you hover over it. 
Finally I adapted the counter to the various devices through the use of media queries.
